Idea for a mobile app I had for worship leaders that include notes and starting pitch.

My initial FB post with the rough product pitch (pun intended) and requirements:

iOS app idea free to steal or for someone to suggest something that does all this already.
For worship leading I make a list of songs with which I include notes about verses, key/start note, etc
Also I include any other notes, scriptures, and other things pertaining to the order.
I usually put this information in Evernote and then print it out on a piece of paper that I keep with me.
I use a Pitch Pipe app on my phone for the key and pitch. Switching back and forth between Evernote and the PitchPipe is too many steps and I'd like the notes to be available at all times.
Using two devices is an option but also clunky.

What I want is a single app that lets me type in the notes and view the full order and have it interpret the information about the key such that I can press a button right on the notes to sound the starting pitch.

Other features might include collapsable sections for lyrics, scriptures or extended notes.
Also the ability to prevent the screen sleeping.
Import from Evernote or Google Docs would be great.

I may try to write this myself some day but if you beat me to it, I will help beta test.

Writing this as an HTML5 web app might be the way to go and make it compatible across devices.
